    <title>My first website</title>
  </head>
<body>
    <p>This is my first website, writing in plain HTML and CSS. I've been stuck in the site generator rabbit hole for too long. I'm over it. Nothing is ever good enough if I don't tinker until it breaks, when I end up starting all over. I just want something simple, that is mine, and that I can play around and experiment with. So...back to basics!</p>
    
    <p>BIG DISCLAIMER! This site is not optimized for perfect code or styling conventions. This is my site, my 'space' to experiment, tinker and enjoy building something lo-fi in an online world increasingly full of big corporate sites, over-design and just too much. I've struggled to create a site for a long time because as I spent time trying different frameworks, I'd get caught up in the "ooh I want that" mindset, while failing to actually create anything.</p>
