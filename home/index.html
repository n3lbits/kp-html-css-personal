  <h2>
    What is Bouldering?

  </h2>
    <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
    </p>
    <p>Experience the perfect blend of physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</p>
<h2>
  Why Bouldering?
</h2>
<p>
  Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced athlete, climbers of all ages can challenge themselves, celebrate each other's successes, and build lasting friendships.
