      <p>This is my first website, writing in plain HTML and CSS. I've been stuck in the site generator rabbit hole for too long. I'm over it. Nothing is ever good enough if I don't tinker until it breaks, when I end up starting all over. I just want something simple, that is mine, and that I can play around and experiment with. So...back to basics!</p>
    
    <p>BIG DISCLAIMER! This site is not optimized for perfect code or styling conventions. This is my site, my 'space' to experiment, tinker and enjoy building something lo-fi in an online world increasingly full of big corporate sites, over-design and just too much. I've struggled to create a site for a long time because as I spent time trying different frameworks, I'd get caught up in the "ooh I want that" mindset, while failing to actually create anything. Everything is styled with Tailwind, which I hate, and everything looks the same!</p>
    </p>
    <p>In order to start from complete scratch, I decided to work through the HTML and CSS course by Kevin Powell. I stumbled on his YT channel recently while researching styling and found an amazingly well done course (not to mention RECENT) course for beginners. While I have worked with HTML and CSS extensively on my own, it's been very patchy and unstructured. I've worked with several SSGs and I'm tired of the black holes I end up in. I've watched about 25% of the YT course so far and found that it's even better when combined with the content on the website. So, I've decided that it will provide a way to use what I already know, while also going back to the beginning to learn how things really work and the proper way to start from scratch.</p>
